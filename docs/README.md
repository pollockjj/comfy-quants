# Comfy Quants documentation

Start with the quantization format you want to produce. Format pages link to the
model-family flows currently implemented for that format.

## Start here

| Goal | Page |
| --- | --- |
| Choose a quantization format | [`quantization/README.md`](quantization/README.md) |
| Export FP8 checkpoints | [`quantization/fp8.md`](quantization/fp8.md) |
| Export INT8 W8A8 (+ConvRot) checkpoints | [`quantization/int8_w8a8.md`](quantization/int8_w8a8.md) |
| Export MXFP8 (microscaling, Blackwell) checkpoints | [`quantization/mxfp8.md`](quantization/mxfp8.md) |
| Export NVFP4 (FP4 microscaling, Blackwell) checkpoints | [`quantization/nvfp4.md`](quantization/nvfp4.md) |
| Quantize the Anima family (FP8/MXFP8/NVFP4) | [`quantization/anima.md`](quantization/anima.md) |
| Export INT4 tile-pack checkpoints | [`quantization/int4.md`](quantization/int4.md) |
| Look up command syntax | [`cli.md`](cli.md) |
| Understand repository architecture | [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) |

## ComfyUI integration model

Run quantization with this package, then load the exported artifact with a
compatible ComfyUI setup. Downstream custom-node projects can depend on
`comfy-quants` and call its CLI or Python API when they need an in-UI workflow.
